# Simon Game

## Remember this rules

1 -> Game Start: The game begins by lighting up one of four colored buttons (red, blue, green, yellow) and playing a sound.

2 -> Player's Turn: You need to press the buttons in the same order as they light up.

3 -> Repeating Sequences: After you correctly repeat the sequence, the game adds one more light to the sequence.

4 -> Increasing Difficulty: The sequence keeps getting longer and harder as you go, and you have to remember the order of lights and sounds.

5 -> Mistake: If you press the wrong button or the sequence is incorrect, the game ends.

6 -> Objective: The goal is to repeat the longest sequence possible without making a mistake.
